        <h2>My first steps into IT and how I got to where I am now.</h2>
        <p>I first got into IT back in 2004 when I went into an interview for a
            helpdesk position with Advanced Technology Services, aka ATS, and that 
            position was an hour commute from home to the office.  Not
            even two hours after that interview, actually on my way baack home I 
            received a call from the hiring manager offering me the job which I 
            obvious accepted it.  From my first day there I knew right away that 
            was going to be where my career was going to start in computers.</p>
        <p>I still had to deal with a commute to work and from work which lasted
            a total of an entire year.  I soon moved to Peoria where I continued 
            my career with ATS for the next 6 years.</p>
        <p>I moved up the chain of commannd pretty fast first making level two admin
            of Lotus Notes, where I could create distribution groups, adjust accounts
            and troubleshoot someone's account to the best of my ability with 
            the access I had at level two.</p>
            <p>Eventually I was given the promotion of team lead of third shift where
            I really began to blossom more in depth of my career.  I had a total
            of anywhere between eight to eleven agents that I looked over and assisted
            with.  I would help them with all that I could during that time and make
            recommendations.  I also had the responsibilty of writing up a nightly
            report of all that happened during that shift to management and if 
            something did arise that may cause problems for them during the next shift
            or day I would include that into my report.</p>
            While around my nineth year at ATS I was recruited to work with the team
            that handled their high priority and critical issues that would come up
            and that company was called Infosys.  Their manager seen all that I was 
            capable of and my potential and they put me in as a Major Incident Manager.
            It was here that I learned about ITIL and ended up earning a certifcation
            with ITIL 4.  During my next 6 years with Infosys I would be put on
            the contract role with Google, Intel, and Caterpillar all of which I was 
            a kept the same role as Major Incident Manager.
            What a Major Incident Manager did was handle high priority and critical
            issues for the company that you were working with at that time.  I would
            be in charge of getting of first getting an idea of what the issue was and 
            all the support agents that I would need to get on a conference call to resolve
            the issue.  If the issue went on for a number of hours I would eventually 
            need to get management on the call if not resolved.  I also had to keep a contact
            from the site that was being impacted to clear with us if the issue has been
            resolved or not and if it did not we would continue support until it was.</p>
            <p>I eventually moved out of Infosys to my next career move which was to Caresoft
            Global where I worked as an IT associate at a walk up help desk basically.
            We would troubleshoot hardware, software, and account issues.</p>
            <p>My next career move was not in IT which was a low point for me because it
            it was out of my field of the career that I cared most about.  The role was 
            for State Farm where I assisted insurance agents with their customers.  I would
            have to explain their customer's coverage with auto, home, and renter's insurance.
            There were times where I would have to change something on the account for that 
            customer which did come up very often, or I would need to issue out a refund check as 
            well.</p>
            <p>My role at State Farm only last a little over a year and then I was able to 
            make my way back into IT.  This is where I am now with Cognizant working first on
            role with Country Financial as a Tier Three Support agent.  I would take care of
            ordering new phones for employees, new MiFis, iPads, and also troubleshoot them.
